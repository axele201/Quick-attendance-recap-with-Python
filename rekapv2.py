? Sorry, friends, I deleted my latest post. Apparently, there are some people who can't appreciate something that was made for free and instead blamed the program. 
? Just to clarify, the program was already noted as not being directly connected to the database. It manually takes a copy of the data from the database and creates a new Excel document with the same structure and data. 
?The attendance times were only used for recap purposes.
